Devops:- It is a combination of 2 words 
1)devlopment 2)operations
--------------------------------------------------
We have lot of tools involved in Devops
1)Git it is a repository :- In this we create a repository and store our projects.we create branches which indicates the group members in the project.
example there are 10 members means we have to create 10 banches.Then we can merge these banches into a main repository.
example:-
1)login  2)registration module.3)service module 4)feedback module 5)shopping cart
The repository will be 2 types 1)local -in your system 2)global -in the cloud or internet.
benefit :- 
1) if your system crash we can have the backup .
2)you can share with any one over the globe by sharing the link.
3)creating braches and merging it for local storage.
